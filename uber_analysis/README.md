## Introduction
[link](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) <- link to the information page

I will analyze the data, build a database model, and make a conclusion based on the data obtained. I will also create a visual dashboard in Power BI. I will go through all the stages of data analysis.

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The Commission's Board consists of nine members, eight of whom are unsalaried Commissioners. The salaried Chair/ Commissioner presides over regularly scheduled public commission meetings and is the head of the agency, which maintains a staff of approximately 600 TLC employees.


Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.
