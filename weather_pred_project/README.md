# Weather prediction Machine Learning project

## Project Overview

**In this project I will use machine learning models to predict the weather. I'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. This project is aimed at improving the understanding of libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**

## Project Steps

- Getting Data
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Creating
- Getting Predictions
