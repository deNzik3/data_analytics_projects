# Data Analyst Portfolio - Denis Ivanov

## About
I started doing analytics two years ago, as it has always been very interesting to work with numbers. Quickly mastered at a good level libraries for data analysis and visualization, as well as for ML. Also was a team leader at a Hackathon from the university. Together with the university team, I was doing a marketing research, where I was engaged in visualization. Was engaged in the development of a recommendation system for films, also have a leadership stronghold, was a team leader at a Hackathon.


I have experience working with Data Bases: Greenplum/PostgreSQL at a high level. I work with libraries for data analysis in Python. Compiled Database schemas as part of university tasks. I like to participate in ML competitions on Kaggle. I am actively developing in this direction.


## Education
- **2021-2026 National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow - IFTEB, Economics Security, Expert**

## Job experience

* Product Analyst at Tinkoff bank

Worked in the department of Qualified Electronic Signature for Business and was also an analyst in the team of electronic signature for individuals. I built an analytics system from scratch (before that there was no analyst in the team). Was an analyst in two products at once and was responsible for building an analytical systems and ad-hoc tasks or huge projects, for example building a customer's funnel or analyzing the customer roadmap and find weak points.

**Technology stack:**
* structuring data in DWH
* A/B testing
* dashboards 
* data visualization in Python
* data analysis

**Results:**
* built basic product analytics
* launched a new feature using an A/B test
* automated the analytics process
* dashboards with main metrics of two products
* navigation system for product analytics on Wiki
* made a calculator for the design of A/B tests



This portfolio was created to show my projects in this field. Also here are my achievements, certificates and it is a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. This portfolio is updated on a regular basis.

## Micro Projects

### Recommendation systems
* [Movie recommendation system](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/movie_rec_project): a model that can offer a movie to a client based on similar movies viewed

### ML projects
* [Weather predictions](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/weather_pred_project): after analyzing the data, I built a visualization, as well as also built an ML model for predicting temperature based on data
* [Predicting the number of Olympic medals](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/olympic_pred_project): the project shows the ability to work with ML models and an understanding of how models work
