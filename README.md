# Data Analyst Portfolio - Denis Ivanov

## About
I started doing analytics two years ago, as it has always been very interesting to work with numbers. Quickly mastered at a good level libraries for data analysis and visualization, as well as for ML. Also was a team leader at a Hackathon from the university. Together with the university team, I conducted marketing research, where I was engaged in visualization. Was engaged in the development of a recommendation system for films. Also, based on the data obtained, I performed binary analysis, created ML models.

## Education
- **2021-2026 National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow - IFTEB, Economics Security, Expert**




This portfolio was created to show my projects in this field. Also here are my achievements, certificates and it is a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. This portfolio is updated on a regular basis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data engineering, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, machine learning, git


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.


**Results:** Conducted a full analysis of the taxi operation, built an ML model, and also made the final report

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, machine learning


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.


**Results:** Here I built a function that might predict weather

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, statistics,machine learning, data visualization, linear regression, model evaluation 


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Scikit-learn


**Results:** Now I can predict how many medals a country can get at the Olympics

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, statistics, machine learning, data visualization, linear regression, rigde regression, lasso regression, KNN, decision tree


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Scikit-learn


**Results:** Here I tried to find patterns in price formation and build a model, now we can predict the price of a laptop by its components
