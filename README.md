## Micro Projects

### Recommendation systems
* [Movie recommendation system](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/movie_rec_project): a model that can offer a movie to a client based on similar movies viewed

### ML projects
* [Weather predictions](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/weather_pred_project): after analyzing the data, I built a visualization, as well as also built an ML model for predicting temperature based on data
* [Predicting the number of Olympic medals](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/olympic_pred_project): the project shows the ability to work with ML models and an understanding of how models work
