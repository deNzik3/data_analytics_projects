# Data Analyst Portfolio - Denis Ivanov

## About
My name is Denis and perhaps as you already know I am a 2nd year student at National Research Nuclear University MEPhI with a degree in Economics. I started learning data analytics and data science two years ago and have been actively developing to this day and still, taking various courses and learning new information. My main programming languages are Python and SQL, in which I am good at libraries for data analysis and visualization, and with the help of python I can write SQL code using libraries PandaSQL or PySparkSQL. 






This portfolio was created to show my projects in this field. Also here are my achievements, certificates and it is a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. This portfolio is updated on a regular basis.

## Portfolio projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, machine learning


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.


**Results:** Here I built a function that might predict weather

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, statistics,machine learning, data visualization, linear regression, model evaluation 


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Scikit-learn


**Results:** Now I can predict how many medals a country can get at the Olympics

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, statistics, machine learning, data visualization, linear regression, rigde regression, lasso regression, KNN, decision tree


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Scikit-learn


**Results:** Here I tried to find patterns in price formation and build a model, now we can predict the price of a laptop by its components
