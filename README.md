# Data Analyst Portfolio - Denis Ivanov

## About
I started doing analytics two years ago, as it has always been very interesting to work with numbers. Quickly mastered at a good level libraries for data analysis and visualization, as well as for ML. Also was a team leader at a Hackathon from the university. Together with the university team, I conducted marketing research, where I was engaged in visualization. Was engaged in the development of a recommendation system for films. Also, based on the data obtained, I performed binary analysis, created ML models.

## Education
- **2021-2026 National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow - IFTEB, Economics Security, Expert**




This portfolio was created to show my projects in this field. Also here are my achievements, certificates and it is a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. This portfolio is updated on a regular basis.

## Micro Projects

### Recommendation systems
* [Movie recommendation system](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/movie_rec_project): Created a model that recommends a movie by its title. Collaborative filtering

### ML projects
* [Weather predictions](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/weather_pred_project): I made EDA, and also built an ML model for predicting temperature based on data
* [Predicting the number of Olympic medals](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/olympic_pred_project): Thanks to this project, we can now, based on data from previous years, roughly predict the number of medals received at the Olympic Games

### Challenges
