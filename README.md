# Data Analyst Portfolio - Denis Ivanov

## About
I started doing analytics two years ago, as it has always been very interesting to work with numbers. Quickly mastered at a good level libraries for data analysis and visualization, as well as for ML. Also was a team leader at a Hackathon from the university. Together with the university team, I conducted marketing research, where I was engaged in visualization. Was engaged in the development of a recommendation system for films. Also, based on the data obtained, I performed binary analysis, created ML models.

## Education
- **2021-2026 National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow - IFTEB, Economics Security, Expert**

## Job experience

* Junior Product Analyst at [Tinkoff](https://www.tinkoff.ru)



Worked in the department of Qualified Electronic Signature for Business. I built an analytics system from scratch (before that there was no analyst in the team). Created basic product analytics.

**Technology stack:**
* structuring data in DWH
* A/B testing
* created dashboards based on the main metrics
* data visualization in Python
* data analysis
* A/B test design

**Results:**
* built basic product analytics
* launched a new feature using an A/B test
* built OKR for a year with the help of analytics
* automated the analytics process
* made a calculator for the design of A/B tests



This portfolio was created to show my projects in this field. Also here are my achievements, certificates and it is a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. This portfolio is updated on a regular basis.

## Micro Projects

### Recommendation systems
* [Movie recommendation system](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/movie_rec_project): a model that can offer a movie to a client based on similar movies viewed

### ML projects
* [Weather predictions](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/weather_pred_project): after analyzing the data, I built a visualization, as well as also built an ML model for predicting temperature based on data
* [Predicting the number of Olympic medals](https://github.com/densivanov/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/olympic_pred_project): the project shows the ability to work with ML models and an understanding of how models work
